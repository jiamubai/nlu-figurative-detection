Bartok_7190_7329,0.5588235294117648,0.38461538461538447,0.5000000000000001,"Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths."
Bartok_7617_7722,0.5294117647058825,0.423076923076923,0.40909090909090906,"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯."

Bartok_7860_7988,0.47058823529411775,0.423076923076923,0.40909090909090906,"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F."

Bartok_8345_8415,0.5294117647058825,0.46153846153846134,0.5000000000000001,This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm.

Bartok_8416_8559,0.5294117647058825,0.38461538461538447,0.4545454545454545,"155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2."

Bartok_8841_8999,0.5294117647058825,0.423076923076923,0.4545454545454545,"This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8."
